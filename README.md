Hello All!
There are currently two modes on my website.
First is before anything is selected in which you can just draw random cards from a deck.
Second is highest wins. 
Each turn points based on the card you beat in that round.
It will go through the whole deck and whoever has the highest score is the winner!
You can also reset at any time with the reset button.
More game modes will be added in the near future.
